Implement a form of Selective Repeat ARQ

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Repeat_ARQ

- Float verifys communication with control station and sends number of data values
- Float sends the number of data values, then all data
- Each piece of data has a sequential ID
- The control station records any IDs that are missing
- The control station sends a request for all missing IDs
- The float responds with the missing data
- Repeats until all data has beeen sucessfully recieved

Example:

Float sends:
DataCount = 5

Computer recieves:
DataCount = 5

Computer sends: 
TXDATA

Float recieves and processes command;

Float sends:
5, Data
4, Data
3, Data
2, Data
1, Data

Computer recieves:
4, Data
3, Data
1, Data

Computer sends:
RPDATA=5,1

Float sends:
5, Data
4, Data

Computer recieves:
5, Data

Computer sends:
RPDATA=1

Float sends: 
1, Data

Computer recieves:
1, Data

Computer sends:
RCVDATA
